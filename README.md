# FungAi - Mushroom Image Classification Android App

## Overview
FungAi is an Android application designed to classify mushroom species based on images. Developed as a final year project, this app leverages a machine learning model trained on a dataset sourced from Kaggle to provide accurate mushroom identification. The app outputs the mushroom name, provides a Wikipedia button for additional information, and indicates the edibility status (edible, non-edible, poisonous). Additionally, FungAi includes a community feed feature, allowing mushroom enthusiasts to post images and comments.

## Features
- **Mushroom Identification**: Classify mushroom species from captured images.
- **Edibility Indicator**: Determine whether a mushroom is edible, non-edible, or poisonous.
- **Wikipedia Button**: Access detailed information about the identified mushroom species with a single click.
- **Community Feed**: Share and comment on mushroom images with a community of enthusiasts.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive and easy-to-navigate UI designed for all users.

## Technical Details
- **Language**: Java
- **Model**: Custom-trained Deep Learning model using a dataset from Kaggle of 93 Mushroom Species
- **Model Integration**: Integrated with TensorFlow Lite for on-device inference
- **Platform**: Android

## Usage
1. Launch the FungAi app.
2. Capture or select an image of the mushroom.
3. View the classification result, including the mushroom name and edibility status.
4. Click the Wikipedia button for more information about the mushroom species.
5. Post images and interact with other users in the community feed.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training the model is sourced from Kaggle. It contains images and labels for various mushroom species, facilitating accurate classification and edibility prediction.

## Model
The deep learning model used in FungAi is trained using TensorFlow and converted to TensorFlow Lite for seamless integration into the Android app. The model ensures efficient and accurate mushroom classification on-device.
